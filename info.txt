== Quantum Mini Game ==

Welcome to the Quantum Mini Game! Your goal is to guess the correct superposition state of a qubit. Are you ready?

Instructions:
1. You will be given a qubit in a superposition state.
2. The qubit can be in either the |0> state or the |1> state, or a superposition of both.
3. You need to guess the state of the qubit.
4. Type either '0' for |0>, '1' for |1>, or 's' for superposition.
5. The game will reveal the actual state of the qubit and let you know if your guess was correct.

Let's begin!

=== Round 1 ===

Qubit: [ ]   <- Initial superposition state

Your Guess: [ ]

=== Round 2 ===

Qubit: [0]   <- Actual state revealed

Your Guess: [00]

=== Round 3 ===

Qubit: [ ]   <- Initial superposition state

Your Guess: [ ]

=== Round N ===

Qubit: [1]   <- Actual state revealed

Your Guess: [ ]

=== Game Over ===

Congratulations! You completed the Quantum Mini Game. Your final score is: X out of N.

Thank you for playing!
